 - general terms: integer = signed value
 - general values: byte/char/octet = 8-bit value ; short/word = 16-bit value ;
                    long = 32-bit value
 - fixed point values: value made up of an integer for whole numbers
                        and an unsigned value for the decimal
 - binary values: base-2 long unsigned values (values from 0 and 1)
 - octal values: base-8 long unsigned values (values from 0 through to 7)

Developed for the compressing of moving pictures and associated audio and then the
combining of one or more elementary streams of video and audio, as well as, other
data into single or multiple streams which are suitable for storage or
transmission.  This is specified in version two in two forms: the Program Stream and the
Transport Stream.  Each is optimised for a different set of applications such as
ATM networks, DBS (Ku-band), station feeds (C-Band), subscription services (CATV bands),
local stations (UHF and VHF bands) which are error prone transmissions so they use
transport streams.  Video CDs (white book) and DVD (UDF VOB) are stored content
so they use v2 program or v1 system streams.

ISO/IEC 11172-2 supports a maximum bit rate of 1.5 Mbits/sec (187.5 kB/sec)

  160 to 64 kbits/sec (20 to 8 kB/sec)
ISO/IEC 13818-3 and Thompson Layers support bit rates from
